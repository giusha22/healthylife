        <p class="pabout">Solid wellness companies are built in decades, not years.
            Since 1983, the American Institute for Preventive Medicine has been internationally recognized for its ability to present health information and programs in ways that increase engagement, motivation, and behavior change.
            
            Our expertise in reducing healthcare costs and absenteeism, while increasing productivity, has helped over 13,000 organizations. AIPM programs have received awards from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Department of Health and Human Services, President’s Council on Physical Fitness and Sports, and Association for Worksite Health Promotion.
            
            AIPM is one of the first five companies to receive URAC Accreditation for Comprehensive Wellness. Achievement of this status demonstrates a company has met or exceeded industry recognized standards for wellness programs. Accredited companies must demonstrate they use evidence– based tools and interventions.
