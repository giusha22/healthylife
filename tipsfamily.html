                Your family is where you learn who you are and how to relate to others. It plays a vital role in fulfilling the human need to belong and have close, long-term relationships. Whether you are a child, teen, or adult, family experiences can promote or hinder your well-being.

Many of us are spending much more time together as a family. Be sure to take some time to focus on building connections for stronger and more resilient family relationships.

Live a healthy lifestyle together. Plan for, shop, and eat healthy foods. Exercise as a family if you can. Or, promote physical activity suited for each family member. Get enough sleep.
Plan to eat at least one meal a day together. Have each person talk about his or her day, such as stating the best part and worst part.
Spend time together. Attend important events for each family member.
Express care and concern. Be available to help each other out. Listen, listen, listen.
Practice good manners. Say, “Thank you” and “You’re welcome.” Make it a practice to send thank you calls, notes, letters, or emails to others for gifts and other acts of kindness.
Express affection. Say, “I love you,” “I care about you,” and “You mean a lot to me.”
Discuss the value of the family as a whole. Encourage individual expression and development.
Define clear, yet flexible roles for family members. Assign family chores.
Keep the house as organized as possible.
Discuss the need to adapt to changes and deal with stressful events.
Seek professional help for problems the family cannot deal with on its own.
